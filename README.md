# Paradox-v2
Paradox but hopefully not trash anymore

# Contributions
Really? You wanna help out with this mess? Well, first we'll have to deal with:
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install all the required packages
3. Create a new bot on Discord
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`, and fill it in with all the required values

And then you're set!

## Issues
The bot undoubtedly will have problems that'll need fixing. Report them [here.](https://github.com/benzarr410/Paradox-v2/issues/) You can request features there too!
